-- Welcome to Haskellings!
-- This is your first exercise.
-- The goal is to make this program print "Hello, Haskellings!" to the console.
--
-- TODO: Complete the `main` function below.
-- You'll need to use the `putStrLn` function.
--
-- When you're ready, save the file and the `haskellings-watcher`
-- should attempt to compile and run it.
--
-- If you see "Hello, Haskellings!" and a success message from the watcher,
-- you've done it!


-- I AM NOT DONE
module Main (main) where -- Exercise files should typically be `module Main` to be runnable

main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- Replace the line below with the correct function call
  putStrLn "TODO: Print the greeting here"
