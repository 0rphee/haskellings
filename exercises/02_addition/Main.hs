-- exercises/02_addition/Main.hs
-- Welcome to Exercise 2: Addition!
-- Your task is to write a Haskell program that adds two numbers and prints the result.
--
-- TODO: Complete the `main` function below.
-- Use the `print` function to output the result of 7 + 5.
--
-- When you're ready, save the file and the watcher should attempt to compile and run it.
--
-- If you see "12" and a success message from the watcher, you're done!

module Main (main) where

main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- Replace the line below with the correct addition and print
  print "TODO: Print the sum of 7 and 5"
